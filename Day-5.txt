✅ What I Learned Today:

📌 Semantic HTML Tags:
	•	Tags that describe the meaning of the content.
	•	Help with better structure, SEO, and accessibility.
	•	Common semantic tags:
	•	<header> – Defines the page or section header
	•	<footer> – Defines the footer
	•	<nav> – For navigation links
	•	<section> – A distinct section of the page
	•	<article> – Independent, self-contained content
	•	<aside> – For sidebars or related content

📌 Multimedia Tags:
	•	Tags used to embed audio and video in a webpage.
	•	<audio> and <video> tags with controls attribute to display playback controls.
	•	Supported file formats include .mp3, .mp4, etc.
